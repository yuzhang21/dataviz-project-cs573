# Data Visualization Project (CS573)
#dataviz-project-templateA-proposal
A project template version A with initial proposals for US Flu Surveillance Data Review. 

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is a multi-year flu patient visits data collected by healthcare providers across the United States, who participated in the Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet). 
[Weely U.S. Influenza Surveillance Reports](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm#ILIMap) are generated from the ILINet Program, which presents an [interactive FluView visualization](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html) of the data. 
In this proposal, I am going to present the data with more visualizations in order to best answer the questions about the data.
